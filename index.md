### CPSC 120

* Lab 02

	Was a fairly simple lab, I’ve programmed C++ before but it has been a while since I have been focusing on learning how to use python more effectively. It was a nice opportunity to begin to refamiliarize myself with the syntax of the language and get used to the conventions of the C++ language while also teaching my lab partner the basics needed to complete the lab. It also was the first time I used the Google C++ Style Guide to format my code. At first it was a little frustrating, mostly because of having extra spaces in between parts of code or at the end of a line and I didn’t exactly understand how the format checker was communicating where my errors were and what they were. Although after figuring out how the format checker we were using was communicating where format errors were and how to fix them, I was a lot more efficient at fixing the formatting errors in code. Overall a simple lab but I enjoyed getting to program C++ again, it was some good experience with formatting code something I had never done before that, and I enjoyed helping my lab partner learn C++ alongside me.



* Lab 05 

	This lab was also fairly simple, but I believe the simplicity of this lab actually aided in the learning of the concepts related to what we were programming for this assignment. Although my lab session only were assigned to complete the first part of the lab, me and my lab partner I believe learned some valuable information in relation to vectors and arguments that the main function takes. I learned that the argv argument is used as a container for all the arguments being given to the command line when program executable is run. The other argument argc is used to store the length of that container of arguments supplied through the command line execution.  Vectors me and my lab partner learned were containers of a specific type of data, which we used to store string variables we got from the command line arguments in the main function. We used these variables to take input from the user before the program even runs, which is very useful and can be used for lots of interesting things. This would even allow us to write C++ programs that are used as commands, maybe to create something like sorting all the names in a csv file or doing other data processing for files in your directories. I also enjoyed explaining how containers like vectors store their information contiguously in memory, which he said helped him understand how containers in C++ and in programming worked. Overall a pretty good lab we learned a lot and it helped me see the value in the pair programming we did over the duration of this course.

* Lab 09

	I appreciated doing this lab, we were fstreams to read and write information to files. This is a very practical technique and used all the time in programming. I enjoyed working with my partner for this lab as he also had experience writing C++ code, we got along well and enjoyed talking about programming together. We used ifstream file object and got a list of read words from a file. We then compared them to a list of words from a list of words we were treating as a dictionary of word spellings. If they were not on that list we treated them as misspelled which is somewhat like how a real spell checker for something like Microsoft word would work, although we used a much smaller dictionary to check spellings against, I would assume to simplify the lab for us students and minimizing the amount of data we had to process. We also used fstreams to practice storing information on a file for later use by a separate program. This was valuable to see because it shows us how seperate programs can interact by storing information on files and reading that stored information off of those files. Overall I enjoyed this lab, and I enjoyed getting to work on it with a lab partner who is also experienced with C++.
